# Final Project

An exercise to put to practice software development teamwork, subsystem communication, containers, deployment, and CI/CD pipelines. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

## Description

Our Resume Builder is a streamlined webapp that allows users to easily build a formatted resume. It also stores users' generated resumes to be accessed at will.

## Run the app

Start by building:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

If you've already built previously, you may compose the containers like so:

```
docker-compose up
```

Once that is completed, you can access the site [HERE](http://127.0.0.1:5002)
